Show all work/steps/calculations using a combination of code and Markdown. You will submit only this notebook named: [jhed_id].ipynb back to Blackboard from whence you downloaded it. Do not return the data to me.\n","2. **All** work is to be your own. This is not a group project. You may, however, use code from the lectures and labs. Provide citations for any code that is not your own. You may also consult Stackoverflow, etc. This is not by any means \"closed book\" or anything like that. Basically, I need to see if *you* learned the concepts from the Lectures, *Fundamentals*, and Labs.\n","3. Add whatever markdown or code cells you need in each part to explain and calculate your answers.

We learned how to build and interpret multivariate models by using domain knowledge, comparing the predicted and actual values of the coefficients and the credible intervals, and looking at residuals. We also applied transformations to make the models perform better and increase interpretability.\n","\n","Using the techniques covered during Modules 9 and 10 (lectures, labs, course notes), **build, describe, and use** a linear regression model that estimates the target variable `mpg` for the accompanying auto data set. You may use other techniques you know but you must at least use the techniques described in class and call out and describe anything \"extra\" that you do and why.\n","\n","Do **not** use any feature selection techniques or anything other than linear regression. Follow the method described in class.\n","\n","The instructions say build, **describe, and use**. You must describe all aspects of your final model (all the parameters and metrics) and use it to predict one value as described in the course notes."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FofBSkjuFtTZ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1.1 - ETL\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"J_R3teL9Fv0S","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FPDyEaJOFwIo","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1.2 - EDA\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"x7aocAadFy6f","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6_0fFpfg_Yeq","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1.3 - Build the model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jRFNLQ7ZF7GE","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VH-z_zTM5TtV","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1.4 - Describe the model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PaNYI6ErF8Xa","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mZt9616O5W40","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1.5 - Use the model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"k36lbHlqF9BJ","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Zeo-_jQWGDuN","colab_type":"text"},"source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","**CHECK LIST**\n","\n","Before you submit this assignent, go back and review the directions to ensure that you have followed each instruction.\n","\n","\n","\n","*   Have you completed every section and answered every question asked?\n","*   For every question, have you described your approach and explained your results?\n","*   Have you checked for spelling and grammar errors?\n","*   Are your code blocks free of any errors?\n","*   Have you *SAVED* your notebook?\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ngng_x5xGEMP","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
